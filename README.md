# InventoryUpdate
With this resource, you can update the title of almost every inventory (some limitations, read below) without the need of reopening the inventory or resetting the cursor.

Some limitations / notes:
* You can't change the title from a beacon, creative, or player inventory. (any version).
* You can't change the title from an anvil or workbench if you're developing 1.13 or below.
* There's a visual glitch when updating a shulker box (barely noticeable), the inventory get a bit bigger, nothing to worry about though. I'ts fixed in 1.14+.
* Of couse you can use colors, but you need to pass it already translated. I didn't add it because maybe you have your own method to translate colors if you're using 1.16 with HEX colors.
